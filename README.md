Password Generator
Welcome to the Password Generator project, implemented in Python, utilizing lists, loops, ranges, and code blocks to create randomized and secure passwords! 🔒🔑

Project Overview:
This Python script generates strong and customizable passwords based on user-defined criteria. It demonstrates proficiency in utilizing Python lists for storing characters, loops for generating multiple passwords, ranges for defining password length, and code blocks for structured logic.

Key Features:
Customizable Passwords: Define password length and complexity.
Randomization: Generates passwords with randomized characters.
Python Lists: Stores character sets (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters).
Loops and Ranges: Iterates to generate multiple passwords of varying lengths.
Code Blocks: Organizes logic for password generation and ensures security parameters.
How It Works:
Define Parameters: Input desired password length and complexity.
Generate Passwords: Utilize loops to create multiple passwords meeting specified criteria.
Secure and Randomized: Incorporate randomization to enhance password strength and security.
